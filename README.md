# Shibby-TokenLock

All team tokens are locked up with the TokenTimelock contract of openzeppelin:
https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/TokenTimelock.sol



8% of the 1 Billion have been sent to the smart contracts which will lock them until the release date. This will incentivize the team to make this project a success.
You can verify the release date yourself by converting the "releaseTime" from epoch-format to a human-readable-format: https://www.epochconverter.com/
